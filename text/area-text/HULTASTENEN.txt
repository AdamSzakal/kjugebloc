Hultastenen is without a doubt the best single bloc in the south of Sweden—sitting just by the road it's packed with steep overhanging lines. The concentration of difficult climbs is very high, among them the first 8C in the country: 'Den nattliga havsfärden'. There are a few easier climbs on the main bloc as well, however most of the good stuff is in the moderate to hard grade-range.

This massive boulder was first discovered by Ola Modéer and subsequently developed by him, Simon Jonegård and later also Harald Bohlin. Visiting Frenchmen Tony Lamiche and Julien Nadiras put up the king-line on the backside in 2006, dubbing it 'Benchmark 7B+' – a reference to all the sandbagged problems in Kjugekull. The sit to the same line might very well be one of the best lines in Sweden and most certainly in Skåne.

Scattered around Hultastenen, in the surrounding forest, are a dozen other blocs of the same pleasant rock quality. Most of them lowballs in the easier grades, but a couple of fine highballs have also been established. It's a small hike to get there and probably a bit of searching as well, but it'll be worth the effort!
