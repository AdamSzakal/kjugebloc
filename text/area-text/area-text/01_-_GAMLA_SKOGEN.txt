Gamla skogen is one of the oldest parts of Kjugekull, in the sense that people started climbing there as early as 1992, and perhaps even some years before that! It's an open environment with sizeable boulders dispersed among old towering beech-trees. Here you can test your skills on classics first ascended several decades ago, and if you walk to the northernmost corner you'll find yourself in the presence of some massive giants with imposing lines!
